# HipPy
Image Processing and Target Recognition, written by the Project Hex team for entry to the IMechE UAS challenge 2018/19.

Repo served as a code dump and transfer tool between systems, no proper structure or process used - code was never intended for public use; it probably won't run

Requirements:

- Python 3
- OpenCV 3.4.3 - (OpenCV 4 breaks current code)
- Tesseract 4.0.0 - (https://github.com/thortex/rpi3-tesseract.git)
